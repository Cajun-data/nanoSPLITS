### Abstract
Single-cell multiomics provides comprehensive insights into gene regulatory networks, cellular diversity, and temporal dynamics. While tools for co-profiling single-cell genomes, transcriptomes, or epigenomes are available, accessing proteomes in parallel is more challenging. We developed **nanoSPLITS** (nanodroplet SPlitting for Linked-multimodal Investigations of Trace Samples), an integrated platform that enables global profiling of the transcriptome and proteome from same single cells using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry-based proteomics, respectively. NanoSPLITS can precisely quantify over 5000 genes, 2000 proteins, and 130 phosphopeptides per single cell and identify cell-type-specific markers from these modalities. We demonstrated nanoSPLITS-based single-cell multiomics can provide comprehensive molecular characterizations of both secondary and primary cells, with insights including covarying functional protein/gene clusters and unique phosphorylation events. Finally, we introduced an efficient approach to utilize nanoSPLITS multiomic datasets for annotating unknown cell identities and detecting their protein markers by mapping transcriptomic data to existing single-cell reference databases.
